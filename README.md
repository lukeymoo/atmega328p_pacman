Completed "pacman" on atmega328p

The game mechanics weren't exactly the focus so there is definitely room for improvement with regards to AI & sprites

This was a focus on learning to use hardware timers/ISR, which were used for FPS & game speed, as well as hardware inputs

Pins 0, 1, 2, 3 on PORTC are used for input

I'm using a 128x64 OLED display with a display library I made (read: crappy library)
